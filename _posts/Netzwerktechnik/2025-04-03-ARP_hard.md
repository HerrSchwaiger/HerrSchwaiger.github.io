The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a fundamental component of network communication that facilitates the mapping of IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. ARP is utilized in local area networks (LANs) to ensure that data packets are correctly sent to the appropriate physical devices. The process can be divided into three main phases:

## 1. Table Verification
Before a device sends a data packet to a target IP address, it checks its ARP cache. The ARP cache is a table that stores known mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses. This step is crucial for enhancing network communication efficiency by avoiding unnecessary broadcasts.

- **Entry Found**: If the MAC address for the target IP is present in the cache, the data packet is sent directly using the stored MAC address.
- **Entry Not Found**: If the MAC address is not in the cache, an ARP request is broadcasted on the local network to obtain the necessary information.

### Example

  .center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
}
</style>

In an example network, the device with IP 192.168.1.5 wants to ping the PC with IP 192.168.1.6.
The ARP table at this moment looks like this:

  |Internet Address | Physical Address |
  |-----------------|-------------------|
  |192.168.1.7      |a4:5f:39:c2:1a:66  |

Since there is no entry for 192.168.1.1, an ARP request is sent.
A ping to 192.168.1.17 could be easily performed as the MAC address is already listed in the ARP table.

{: .notice--info}
You can display your computer's ARP table using the command `arp -a`.

## 2. Processing the ARP Request
When a device receives an ARP request, it must decide whether to respond. This is done by comparing the IP address in the request with its own IP address.

- **Relevant Request**: If the IP address in the request matches the device's own IP address, it sends an ARP reply containing its MAC address.
- **Irrelevant Request**: If the IP address does not match, the request is ignored.

### Example

    <figcaption>Fig2: ARP Request</figcaption>
</figure>

The ARP request for the MAC address of 192.168.1.6 was broadcasted to every other network participant.
Since the PC with 192.168.1.7 has a different IP than the one requested, it ignores the request.
The PC with 192.168.1.6 recognizes that its MAC address was requested and sends it back to the sender via an ARP reply.

## 3. Processing the ARP Reply
Once the original device receives an ARP reply, it updates its ARP cache with the new IP-to-MAC address mapping. This ensures that future communications with this IP address are faster and more efficient.

- **Cache Update**: The received MAC address is entered into the ARP cache.
- **Data Transmission**: With the now-known MAC address, the original data packet can be correctly addressed and sent.

### Example

The PC with IP 192.168.1.5 receives the reply from 192.168.1.6 and transfers the contained MAC address into its ARP table:

  |Internet Address | Physical Address |
  |-----------------|-------------------|
  |192.168.1.7      |a4:5f:39:c2:1a:66  |
  |<span style="color:limegreen">  192.168.1.6 </span> | <span style="color:limegreen"> 00:60:47:e5:62:11</span> |

## Conclusion

These three phases—cache verification, processing the ARP request, and processing the ARP reply—form the core of the ARP protocol, enabling efficient and reliable communication in local networks.
